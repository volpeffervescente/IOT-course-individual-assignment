# IoT System with Adaptive Sampling using ESP32 and FreeRTOS

## Overview
This repository contains the source code and documentation for an **IoT system** designed to collect, process, and transmit sensor data efficiently using **adaptive sampling**. The system is built on **ESP32 with FreeRTOS**, utilizing **FFT** for signal analysis and dynamically adjusting the sampling frequency to save energy and reduce communication overhead.

---

## Features
- **Dynamic Sampling Frequency Adjustment**: Adjusts sampling rate based on signal frequency components.
- **FFT-based Analysis**: Uses Fast Fourier Transform to detect dominant frequencies.
- **Data Aggregation**: Computes average values over a moving time window.
- **Dual Communication**:
  - **WiFi (MQTT)**: Sends data to a local edge server.
  - **LoRaWAN + TTN**: Transmits data to the cloud.
- **Performance Metrics**: Includes energy savings, transmission volume, and latency measurement.

## System Architecture

### Hardware Components
- **ESP32 Development Board**
- **Heltec WiFi LoRa V3 Board** (with antenna)
- **Connections**:
  - `GPIO25 (ESP32)` → `GPIO07 (Heltec)`
  - `GND ↔ GND`
  - Use breadboard and jumper wires (or FF jumpers for direct connection)

### Software Components
- **RTOS**: [FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org/)
- **Signal Processing**: [ArduinoFFT](https://github.com/kosme/arduinoFFT)
- **Communication Protocols**:
  - MQTT over WiFi
  - LoRaWAN via [TTN (The Things Network)](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/)

### Prerequisites
- ESP32 board with FreeRTOS support
- Configured MQTT broker
- LoRaWAN gateway with a registered TTN application/account

---

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iot-adaptive-sampling.git
   ```
2. **Open the project in Arduino IDE or PlatformIO**
3. **Install required libraries**
   - ArduinoFFT
   - FreeRTOS (if using Arduino IDE, select ESP32 board with FreeRTOS)
4. **Configure MQTT and LoRaWAN settings** in the source files
5. **Upload firmware** to the ESP32 board
6. **Monitor the Serial output** for live logs and debug info

## Implementation Details

### Input Signal
Generated by the ESP32 DAC on `GPIO25`:
```math
2 \cdot \sin(2\pi \cdot 3t) + 4 \cdot \sin(2\pi \cdot 5t)
```
### Sampling Frequency
- **Max Sampling Rate**: 34.10 kHz (ADC on `GPIO07` of Heltec)
- **Optimal Sampling**: FFT detects a major peak at 6 Hz → Sampling adjusted to **12 Hz** using sampling theorem

### Aggregate Function Computation
- computing the average over a sliding window implemented with a **circular buffer**
- Defined in `window_code`

### MQTT Communication
- Aggregated data (avg) sent to local edge server via MQTT
- "window_code" exploited to compute this task
- adafruit topic is volpeffervescente/feed/avg 
- MQTT broker setup required (e.g., Mosquitto)

### LoRaWAN + TTN Communication
- Aggregated data sent to cloud using LoRa
- LoRaWAN configuration from **Heltec LoRaWAN connectivity repository**
