# IoT System with Adaptive Sampling using ESP32 and FreeRTOS

## Overview
This repository contains the source code and documentation for an **IoT system** designed to collect, process, and transmit sensor data efficiently using **adaptive sampling**. The system is built on **ESP32 with FreeRTOS**, utilizing **FFT** for signal analysis and dynamically adjusting the sampling frequency to save energy and reduce communication overhead.

### Features
- **Dynamic Sampling Frequency Adjustment**: Adjusts sampling rate based on signal frequency components.
- **FFT-based Analysis**: Uses Fast Fourier Transform to detect dominant frequencies.
- **Data Aggregation**: Computes average values over a moving time window.
- **Dual Communication**:
  - **WiFi (MQTT)**: Sends data to a local edge server.
  - **LoRaWAN + TTN**: Transmits data to the cloud.
- **Performance Metrics**: Includes energy savings, transmission volume, and latency measurement.

## Implementation Details

### Input Signal
Generated by the ESP32 DAC on `GPIO25`:
```math
2 \cdot \sin(2\pi \cdot 3t) + 4 \cdot \sin(2\pi \cdot 5t)
```
### Sampling Frequency
- **Max Sampling Rate**: 34.10 kHz (ADC on `GPIO07` of Heltec)
- **Optimal Sampling**: 

***Adaptive Sampling***: The system starts oversampling (16 kHz) and continuously adjusts the sampling frequency based on the Nyquist theorem, 
using FFT to identify the dominant frequency in the signal.
Multitasking with FreeRTOS: The program is structured into three concurrent tasks:
SamplingTask: Samples the analog signal and optionally detects significant changes.
ProcessingTask: Computes the FFT and adjusts the sampling frequency.
MonitorTask: (Optional) Displays runtime metrics (sampling rate, heap usage, stack watermark) on the serial console and OLED display.

***FFT Support***:
arduinoFFT: compatible FFT library.
ESP-DSP: Optimized FFT library leveraging the ESP32's hardware acceleration (included, not used by default).

***Synchronization and Parallelism***: 
Instead of traditional semaphores, this project implements **double-buffering** to safely share data between tasks. Two alternating buffers (`bufferA` and `bufferB`) are used to decouple data acquisition from FFT processing:
- While `SamplingTask` fills one buffer with fresh data,
- `ProcessingTask` concurrently processes the other buffer.
- The roles are swapped after each cycle using a boolean flag, ensuring safe and efficient parallel execution.

Signal Change Detection (Experimental)
A statistical trigger based on mean and standard deviation is optionally available to detect abrupt changes in the input signal and initiate FFT recomputation. However, it comes with limitations:
- It may not detect gradual variations.
- Adds computation overhead and latency.
- Can cause misalignment between batches.

This mechanism is disabled by default in favor of simpler and more robust alternatives, such as interrupts or threshold-based detection.



### Aggregate Function Computation
- computing the average over a sliding window implemented with a **circular buffer**
- Defined in `window_code`

### MQTT Communication
- Aggregated data (avg) sent to local edge server via MQTT
- "window_code" exploited to compute this task
- adafruit topic is volpeffervescente/feed/avg 
- MQTT broker setup required (e.g., Mosquitto)

### LoRaWAN + TTN Communication
- LoRaWAN configuration from [Heltec LoRaWAN connectivity repository](https://github.com/HelTecAutomation/Heltec_ESP32/tree/master)
- Aggregated data (avg) sent to cloud via LoRa
- "window_code" exploited to compute this task
- end device registration (Heltec WiFi LoRa V2 since V3 not available) required on TTN. 
- end device credentials (such as devEUI, appKey, appEUI) given after the registration on TTN app must be copied and pasted in the OTAA section of source code 'LoRaWan'

## Performance Evaluation

### Energy Savings
Compares adaptive sampling vs. fixed over-sampling  
[NOTE: Not final]

**Results**: 
Adaptive Sampling is expected to significantly reduce energy usage. Since data is sampled and transmitted only when necessary, the microcontroller and communication modules can stay in low-power modes longer. This is especially beneficial in low-activity scenarios.
Fixed Oversampling results in higher and constant energy consumption, as the system continuously samples and transmits data, regardless of its relevance.

### Data Transmission Volume
Evaluates reduction in data size using adaptive sampling  
**Results**: 
Adaptive Sampling reduces the amount of data sent over the network by avoiding redundant transmissions. This lowers network load and can improve overall system scalability.
Fixed Oversampling generates a high volume of data, including many unnecessary or repeated values, leading to increased bandwidth usage and storage requirements.

### End-to-End Latency
Measures latency from data generation to reception at edge server  
**Results**: 
Adaptive Sampling may result in slightly lower average latency, as the reduced number of transmissions lessens network congestion and processing delays.
Fixed Oversampling can increase latency under load, especially in systems with multiple nodes or limited bandwidth, due to constant data flow.

## Bonus: Multiple Input Signals
For the bonus assignment, the generation of at least 3 different input signals (some with low frequency and low amplitude, others with high frequency and high amplitude, ecc...) is performed by the DAC of the ESP32 board. This assignment is merged with the signal generation assignment, in the 'sig_gen' source code.   


How different types of an input signal may affect the overall performance in the case of adaptive sampling vs basic/over-sampling:
