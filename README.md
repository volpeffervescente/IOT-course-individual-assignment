# IOT-course-individual-assignment

The goal of the assignment is to create an IoT system that collects information from a sensor, analyses the data locally and communicates to a nearby server an aggregated value of the sensor readings. The IoT system adapts the sampling frequency in order to save energy and reduce communication overhead. The IoT device will be based on an ESP32 prototype board and the firmware will be developed using the FreeRTOS
